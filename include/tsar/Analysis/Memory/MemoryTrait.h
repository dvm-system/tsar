/// \brief This represents list of traits for a memory location which can be
/// recognized by analyzer.
///
/// The following information is available:
/// - is it a location which is not accessed in a region;
/// - is it a location which is explicitly accessed in a region;
/// - is it a location address of which is evaluated;
/// - is it a private location;
/// - is it a last private location;
/// - is it a second to last private location;
/// - is it a dynamic private location;
/// - is it a first private location;
/// - is it a read-only location;
/// - is it a shared location;
/// - is it a location that caused dependence;
/// - is it a loop induction location;
/// - is it a location which is accessed in a loop header;
/// - is it a location with locked traits which should not be further analyzed;
/// - is it a redundant location which can be removed after some transformations;
/// - is it a location which is not redundant;
/// - is it a scalar which has not been promoted to registers;
/// - is it a directly accessed location;
/// - is it an indirectly accessed location with known list of locations which
///   are used to access it.
///
/// If location is not accessed in a region it will be marked as 'no access'
/// only if it has some other traits, otherwise it can be omitted in a list
/// of region traits.
///
/// Location is accessed in a region implicitly if descendant of it in an
/// alias tree will be accessed explicitly. If some other location is
/// accessed due to alias with such location it is not treated.
///
/// There are difference of meaning of some traits for a separate memory
/// location and for a node in alias tree. This relates to explicitly accessed,
/// redundant, not redundant and direct locations. An alias node has
/// one of these traits only if it contains at least one location which has an
/// appropriate trait (locations from descendant nodes are not analyzed
/// in this case).
///
/// Calculation of a last private variables differs depending on internal
/// representation of a loop. There are two type of representations.
/// -# The first type has a following pattern:
/// \code
/// iter: if (...) goto exit;
///           ...
///         goto iter;
/// exit:
/// \endcode
/// For example, representation of a for-loop refers to this type.
/// The candidates for last private variables associated with the for-loop
/// will be stored as second to last privates locations, because
/// the last definition of these locations is executed on the second to the last
/// loop iteration (on the last iteration the loop condition
/// check is executed only).
/// -# The second type has a following pattern:
/// \code
/// iter:
///           ...
///       if (...) goto exit; else goto iter;
/// exit:
/// \endcode
/// For example, representation of a do-while-loop refers to this type.
/// In this case the candidates for last private variables
/// will be stored as last privates locations.
///
/// In some cases it is impossible to determine in static an iteration
/// where the last definition of an location have been executed. Such locations
/// will be stored as dynamic private locations collection.
